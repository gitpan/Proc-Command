1.0 SCOPE
    This paragraph identifies and provides an overview of the released
    files.

  1.1 Identification

    This release, identified in 3.2, is a collection of Perl modules that
    extend the capabilities of the Perl language.

  1.2 System overview

    The "Proc::Command" module extends the Perl language (the system).

    Some Perls under Microsoft windows suffers disabilities over Unix Perls.
    One particular disability is a backtick without the console. Altough the
    Microsoft console, may be started without a window (start command with
    /b option or spawn program call), the Perl system command on windows
    usually create a window. Creating a window causes immense user interface
    problem since it will randomly pop-up and take focus over the current
    window, erasing current entries into that window. Solutions such as
    "Proc::SafePipe" do not run on Perls for Window.

    This module provides an answer by using the "open" command with a pipe
    to provide a backtick without a console that will run under Perls on
    Microsoft Windows.

  1.3 Document overview.

    This document releases Proc::Command version 0.03 providing a
    description of the inventory, installation instructions and other
    information necessary to utilize and track this release.

  3.3 Changes

    Changes are as follows:

    Proc::Command 0.01
        Added a statement to support the VSM platform

        $command = "MCR $command" if $^O eq 'VMS';

    Proc::Command 0.02
        Added a 1 at the end of the code section.

  3.4 Adaptation data.

    This installation requires that the installation site has the Perl
    programming language installed. Installation sites running Microsoft
    Operating systems require the installation of Unix utilities. An
    excellent, highly recommended Unix utilities for Microsoft operating
    systems is unxutils by Karl M. Syring. A copy is available at the
    following web sites:

     http://unxutils.sourceforge.net
     http://packages.SoftwareDiamnds.com

    There are no other additional requirements or tailoring needed of
    configurations files, adaptation data or other software needed for this
    installation particular to any installation site.

  3.7 Possible problems and known errors

    There is still much work needed to ensure the quality of this module as
    follows:

    *   State the functional requirements for each method including not only
        the GO paths but also what to expect for the NOGO paths

    *   All the tests are GO path tests. Should add NOGO tests.

    *   Add the requirements addressed as *# R: * comment to the tests

    *   Write a program to build a matrix to trace test step to the
        requirements and vice versa by parsing the *# R: * comments.
        Automatically insert the matrix in the Test::TestUtil POD.
