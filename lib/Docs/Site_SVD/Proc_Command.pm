 Software Version Description

 for

 Proc::Command - backtick that does not use the shell for Perl under Windows

 Revision: B

 Version: 0.03

=head1 1.0 SCOPE

This paragraph identifies and provides an overview
of the released files.

=head2 1.1 Identification

This release,
identified in L<3.2|/3.2 Inventory of software contents>,
is a collection of Perl modules that
extend the capabilities of the Perl language.

=head2 1.2 System overview

The "L<Proc::Command|Proc::Command>" module extends the Perl language (the system).

Some Perls under Microsoft windows suffers disabilities over Unix Perls.
One particular disability is a backtick without the console.
Altough the Microsoft console, may be started without a window
(start command with /b option or spawn program call), the Perl
system command on windows usually create a window.
Creating a window causes immense user interface problem since 
it will randomly pop-up and take focus over the current window,
erasing current entries into that window.
Solutions such as "Proc::SafePipe" do not run on Perls for Window.

This module provides an answer by using the "open" command with
a pipe to provide a backtick without a console that will run
under Perls on Microsoft Windows.

=head2 1.3 Document overview.

This document releases Proc::Command version 0.03
providing a description of the inventory, installation
instructions and other information necessary to
utilize and track this release.

=head1 3.0 VERSION DESCRIPTION

use the Unix operating
system file specification.

=head2 3.4 Adaptation data.

This installation requires that the installation site
has the Perl programming language installed.
Installation sites running Microsoft Operating systems require
the installation of Unix utilities. 
An excellent, highly recommended Unix utilities for Microsoft
operating systems is unxutils by Karl M. Syring.
A copy is available at the following web sites:

 http://unxutils.sourceforge.net
 http://packages.SoftwareDiamnds.com

There are no other additional requirements or tailoring needed of 
configurations files, adaptation data or other software needed for this
installation particular to any installation site.

=head2 3.5 Related documents.

There are no related documents needed for the installation and
