=head1 NAME

Proc::Command - backtick that does not use the shell for Perl under Windows

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Proc::Command

 @reponse = Proc::Command->command($command)
 @reponse = Proc::Command->command($command,$trys)
 @reponse = Proc::Command->command($command,$trys, $sleep)

 use Proc::Command qw(command)

 @reponse = Proc::Command->command($command)
 @reponse = Proc::Command->command($command,$trys)
 @reponse = Proc::Command->command($command,$trys, $sleep)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Some Perls under Microsoft windows suffers disabilities over Unix Perls.
One particular disability is a backtick without the console.
Altough the Microsoft console, may be started without a window
(start command with /b option or spawn program call), the Perl
system command on windows usually creates a window.
Creating a window causes immense user interface problem since 
it will randomly pop-up and take focus over the current window,
erasing current entries into that window.
Solutions such as "Proc::SafePipe" do not run on Perls for Window.

This module provides an answer by using the "open" command with
a pipe to provide a backtick without a console that will run
under Perls on Microsoft Windows.

=head1 REQUIREMENTS

Coming soon.

=head1 DEMONSTRATION

 ~~~~~~ Demonstration overview ~~~~~

Perl code begins with the prompt

 =>

The selected results from executing the Perl Code 
follow on the next lines. For example,

 => 2 + 2
 4

 ~~~~~~ The demonstration follows ~~~~~

 =>     use File::Spec;
 =>     use File::Package;
 =>     my $fp = 'File::Package';
 =>     my $loaded = '';
 =>  
 =>     my $pc = 'Proc::Command';
 =>     my ($command,$actual);
 => my $errors = $fp->load_package($pc)
 => $errors
 ''

 => $actual = $pc->command('echo hello')
 'hello
 '


=head1 QUALITY ASSURANCE

The module "t::Proc::Command" is the Software
Test Description(STD) module for the "Proc::Command".
module. 

To generate all the test output files, 
run the generated test script,
run the demonstration script and include it results in the "Proc::Command" POD,
execute the following in any directory:

 tmake -test_verbose -replace -run  -pm=t::Proc::Command

Note that F<tmake.pl> must be in the execution path C<$ENV{PATH}>
and the "t" directory containing  "t::Proc::Command" on the same level as the "lib" 
directory that contains the "Proc::Command" module.
